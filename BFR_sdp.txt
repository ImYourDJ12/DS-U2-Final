1. 2 loops. One for moving the animals, and one for looping through bears that are going to
starve.
2. River.place_baby() changes the population and animals list aswell as the animals on
the river itself. River.animal_death() affects self.animals and self.population and the
animals on the board.
3. Animal.collision() triggers the Bear.consume() which then triggers Animal.death() which
then triggers River.death().
4. All of these functions effect the bear and the amount of lives it has.
5. 1. The animal will display in a different place. Animals that collide will be
removed.
   2. When two animals collide the board should not be redraw as it will be redrawn at
   the end of the day.
